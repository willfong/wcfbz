      <h5>Tech Toolbelt</h5>
      <p>It's a requirement for a software engineer to continually learn new technologies and understand they can be used to better solve humanity's problems. While I have a broad experience in many tech stacks, this is currently my preferred "toolbelt":
      <ul>
				<li>GitHub (code is life)</li>
				<li>AWS</li>
				<li>Terraform / Terraform Cloud</li>
				<li>Docker</li>
				<li>Python / FastAPI</li>
				<li>Javascript / Vue.js</li>
				<li>Redis</li>
				<li>SQLite (dude, seriously, it's cool)</li>
      </ul>
